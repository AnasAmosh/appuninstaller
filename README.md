# Batch Uninstaller
A communiy based application, this app will be the chance to learn the best of Android. The project will have a high professional developers to maintain & accept the code while anyone can join any contribute his work into this project.

# Brief 
The idea of the app is that we will provide an app that can uninstall mutiple apps at once for the rooted android devices. Currently there were no open source apps that provide this feature. Requiring root access permission is a scary thing for users so we think that the users will pick our app for this task to achive because we will make it open source.

The app will contains a lot of features that we are going to expose later, but the most important thing here is that we wanted an app that is somehow simple and at the same time we can untilize mutiple aspects of the Android OS so everybodu will get the chance to learn sometnhing new.

# Project Objectives
- Social interaction between the Android cummnity memebers and getting to know each other deeply by woring with each other.
- Build teamwork skills and let the developers collaborate with each other using some of the great tools like Git, Github and Trello.
- Apply the best practices in the Android development.
- Learn to solve some of the new challenges that some of us didn't face it before during his/her work.
- If the app was succesffuly we might be able to montize it, and we think of sending the money we can get from this app to any charitable organization, and thus we can all be proud of this beatiful experince.
